# RainDataThailand_Mini_Project_KJ
Rain Data for Training

My name is Kruawun Jankaew, a mature student pursuing an MSc degree in Data Analytics and Data Science.
This is my very first project with python and matplotlib. I am still learning and there is still much to learn.
This mini project is part of DADS5001 course (Data Analytics and Data Science Tools and Programing) at NIDA (National Instutute of Development Administration).
The goal is to familiarize with python and matplotlib in manipulating and visualizing data.

I use rainfall data from rain station across Thailand from 1987 to (August) 2022 in this mini project.
Main research questions are: 
•	Can we correlate rain fall data in Thailand to el nino or la nina index?
•	What is the la nina index of the year with high anomaly (high rainfall) in Thailand?
•	What is the la nina index of 2022 based on rainfall data (8 months data)?
•	Is there a long-term trend of increasing rainfall? Could it be related to global warming (based on the well-known record of higher global sea surface temperature)?

Feel free to help comment on how to improve my code and suggest data that I can use to improve solving my research questions.
